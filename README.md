# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
    Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
    Using Piviot Tables and Charts to analyze Kickstarter Campaigns.
### Purpose
    To determine trends and correlations between sucessful and failed theater kickstarter campaigns.
## Analysis and Challenges
    In this Analysis we extrapolated kickstarter campaign data and organized it based on goal ammount, success rate, launch month
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    When looking at trends based on launch date we see a large ammount kickstarters starting in the early summer months, and slowly decline throughout the year until their lowest point in December. Not only are the more crowdfunded projects started in the early summer months but there is a higher chance of them being sucessful.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    When comparing outcomes based on goals, there is a signifgantly higher chance of being funded if your goal fell in the 4,999 to less than 1000 range, about 70%.
    At 10000 to 29999 range there is still a good ammount of success, but the success rate declines as goal increases.
    Intrestingly there is a resurgance in success at the 35000 to 44999 range. Although there is only a very small sample size in this range it has a success rate of 66%.
    This potentially is due to the playwright may already be establised and have name recconision to be pull a large ammount of funding.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    Some challanges are it can be difficult to determine the seriousness of the campaigns with the higher goals. 
    There is such a stark contrast in sheer volume of projects with the goal 15000 and up that it feels like those data points could be considered outliers.
    
## Results
    THere deffinately seems to be some sort of correlations between the goal of the project and the season. 
    Projects are more likely to be funded if the goal is smaller, and if it is during the late spring / summer months. 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  
     The most sucessful months to lauch a kickstarer for theater projects were in May and June.
     
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
     Projects that had a goal of 5000 or less had a greater chance of being funded. 
     The percentage of kickstarters failed increased as the goal increased, until you get to the 35,000 to 44,999 goal range.
     These could potentially from high profile playwrights with great name recognition. 
    
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Some other possible tables that we could create are goal range vs percentage funded.
    Also average funding vs the goal.
