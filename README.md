## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  
     The most sucessful months to lauch a kickstarer for theater projects were in May and June.
     
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
     Projects that had a goal of 5000 or less had a greater chance of being funded. 
     The percentage of kickstarters failed increased as the goal increased, until you get to the 35,000 to 44,999 goal range.
     These could potentially from high profile playwrights with great name recognition. 
    
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
